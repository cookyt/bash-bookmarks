Bash Bookmarks
==============

A bookmarking system for bash.

Source `bookmark.bash` in your `.bashrc` to use. It creates a bash `bookmark`
function which is used to add, delete, and list active bookmarks. Run `bookmark
-h` for more info.

The system uses a data file to keep track of bookmarks which defaults to
`$HOME/.bash_bookmark_data` Change the first line of `bookmark.bash` to change
this location.
